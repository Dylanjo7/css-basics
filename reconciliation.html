            <h2>What is Reconciliation</h2>
            <p>
              Reconciliation is an ongoing process through which Indigenous
              peoples and the Crown work cooperatively to establish and maintain
              a mutually respectful framework for living together, with a view
              to fostering strong, healthy, and sustainable Indigenous nations
              within a strong Canada
            </p>

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>
              Both the local indigenous people and Canadian government
              authorities wanted to ensure the security of their lands and
              resources, which led to the establishment of the treaty. With the
              rush of newcomers, the Anishinabe and Swampy Cree Nations tried to
              preserve their precious grounds while gaining stability in the
              transition to a new way of life.

            <h2>Canadian Government Failed indigenous peoples</h2>

            <p>
              "Within a year of the agreement, however, the indigenous
              communities approached the Canadian government declaring that a
              number of the items promised, which would become known as the
              “Outside Promises”, within the treaty had not been handed over to
              them yet, although subjects of the Crown continued to settle the
              land-based upon the agreed-upon Treaty. On April 30, 1875, a
              council of the federal government passed an order stating that it
              must be ensured that all of the Outside Promises were to be
              fulfilled and considered a part of the main agreements within
              Treaty 1. However, due to the different intentions and
              understandings of the Canadian officials and the indigenous
              communities at the time of its creation, this treaty continues to
              be considered controversial well into the 21st century."
