            instrument that establishes obligations between two or more subjects
            of international law (primarily states and international

          <h2>What is Treaty 1</h2>
          <p>
            "<span>Treaty One</span> Nation is composed of the seven First
            Nations who are signatories to the first of the numbered Treaties,
            originally signed on August 3, 1871 at Lower Fort Garry after
            several days of discussions and ceremonies."

          <h2>Significance of Treaty 1</h2>
          <p>
            The signing of Treaty 1 signalled the start of a protracted series
            of treaties that would follow over the ensuing two decades,
            indicating the Canadian government's growing interest in the West as
            more than just a trading hub but also as an area suitable for
            developing agriculture and housing growing populations of settlers
            as well as a peaceful way to annex land. The pact will allow
            Governor Adams Archibald to establish industries like mills and
            farms on the lush area surrounding Lakes Winnipeg and Manitoba as
            well as in the Red River Valley
          </p>

          <h2>Goals</h2>
          <p>
            Both the local indigenous people and Canadian government authorities
            wanted to ensure the security of their lands and resources, which
            led to the establishment of the treaty. With the rush of newcomers,
            the Anishinabe and Swampy Cree Nations tried to preserve their
            precious grounds while gaining stability in the transition to a new
            way of life.
          </p>

          <h2>Canadian Government Failed indigenous peoples</h2>

          <p>
            "Within a year of the agreement, however, the indigenous communities
            approached the Canadian government declaring that a number of the
            items promised, which would become known as the “Outside Promises”,
            within the treaty had not been handed over to them yet, although
            subjects of the Crown continued to settle the land-based upon the
            agreed-upon Treaty. On April 30, 1875, a council of the federal
            government passed an order stating that it must be ensured that all
            of the Outside Promises were to be fulfilled and considered a part
            of the main agreements within Treaty 1. However, due to the
            different intentions and understandings of the Canadian officials
            and the indigenous communities at the time of its creation, this
            treaty continues to be considered controversial well into the 21st
            century."
