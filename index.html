          "Treaty One Nation is composed of the seven First Nations who are
          signatories to the first of the numbered Treaties, originally signed
          on August 3, 1871 at Lower Fort Garry after several days of
          discussions and ceremonies."

          <span>Significance of Treaty 1</span>
        </h2>
        <p>
          The signing of Treaty 1 signalled the start of a protracted series of
          treaties that would follow over the ensuing two decades, indicating
          the Canadian government's growing interest in the West as more than
          just a trading hub but also as an area suitable for developing
          agriculture and housing growing populations of settlers as well as a
          peaceful way to annex land. The pact will allow Governor Adams
          Archibald to establish industries like mills and farms on the lush
          area surrounding Lakes Winnipeg and Manitoba as well as in the Red
          River Valley

          <span>Goals</span>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Both the local indigenous people and Canadian government authorities
          wanted to ensure the security of their lands and resources, which led
          to the establishment of the treaty. With the rush of newcomers, the
          Anishinabe and Swampy Cree Nations tried to preserve their precious
          grounds while gaining stability in the transition to a new way of
          life.

        <h2>
          <span>Canadian Government Failed indigenous peoples</span>
        </h2>

        <p>
          "Within a year of the agreement, however, the indigenous communities
          approached the Canadian government declaring that a number of the
          items promised, which would become known as the “Outside Promises”,
          within the treaty had not been handed over to them yet, although
          subjects of the Crown continued to settle the land-based upon the
          agreed-upon Treaty. On April 30, 1875, a council of the federal
          government passed an order stating that it must be ensured that all of
          the Outside Promises were to be fulfilled and considered a part of the
          main agreements within Treaty 1. However, due to the different
          intentions and understandings of the Canadian officials and the
          indigenous communities at the time of its creation, this treaty
          continues to be considered controversial well into the 21st century."
