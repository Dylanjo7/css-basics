/* 
  I have chosen a monochrome color theme. 
  I have chosen the color based on color psychology and have chosen the color orange because
  it is a meaningful color for the indigenous peoples. I have chosed dark mode because I have 
  many images and I want those images to be impactful on the reader. Since there is a lot of text,
  I have made a section in middle for white and black text for easy reading of the text.

  I also have chosen to have a more basic font because this website is for Grades 4 to 8. I chose
  to style words in paragraphs like the word Treaty One so that it is more impactful.
