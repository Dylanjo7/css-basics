/* 
  I have chosen a monochrome color theme. 
  I have chosen the color based on color psychology and have chosen the color orange because
  it is a meaningful color for the indigenous peoples. I have chosed dark mode because I have 
  many images and I want those images to be impactful on the reader. Since there is a lot of text,
  I have made a section in middle for white and black text for easy reading of the text.

  I also have chosen to have a more basic font because this website is for Grades 4 to 8. I chose
  to style words in paragraphs like the word Treaty One so that it is more impactful.

    This defines our animation.
          
    We define the animation-name as fade-in.
    We define the animation-duration (how long the animation lasts) as 1 second.
    We define the animation-timing-funtion (how the styling changes as it moves through the
    animation) as ease-in, which means it will slowly start the animation and speed up to the end.
    We define the animation-delay as 2 seconds.
    We define the animation-fill-mode (whether the styling is kept at the end of the animation
    or not) to forwards, which means to keep the styling that is at the end of the animation.
    Other animation properties that we do not define in this example are:
          
    animation-iteration-count - how many times you want your animation to run
          
    animation-direction - do you want your animation to go forward (normal)? Backward (reverse)?
