        <h2><span>Terms</span></h2>
        <p>
          On September 12th, 1871, the treaty was formally confirmed by the
          Governor General in Council. Each band was to receive a reserve big
          enough to give each family of five 160 acres (or in like proportion
          for smaller or larger families). Each man, woman, and child was to get
          a three-dollar gratuity (or one-time payment), and each family of five
          was to receive a yearly annuity of $15. The government also committed
          to forbid the introduction or sale of alcohol on reserves and to
          maintain a school on each reserve.

        <h2><span>Significance of Treaty 1</span></h2>
        <p>
          The signing of Treaty 1 signalled the start of a protracted series of
          treaties that would follow over the ensuing two decades, indicating
          the Canadian government's growing interest in the West as more than
          just a trading hub but also as an area suitable for developing
          agriculture and housing growing populations of settlers as well as a
          peaceful way to annex land. The pact will allow Governor Adams
          Archibald to establish industries like mills and farms on the lush
          area surrounding Lakes Winnipeg and Manitoba as well as in the Red
          River Valley

        <h2><span>Goals</span></h2>
        <p>
          Both the local indigenous people and Canadian government authorities
          wanted to ensure the security of their lands and resources, which led
          to the establishment of the treaty. With the rush of newcomers, the
          Anishinabe and Swampy Cree Nations tried to preserve their precious
          grounds while gaining stability in the transition to a new way of
          life.

        <h2><span>Canadian Government Failed indigenous peoples</span></h2>

        <p>
          "Within a year of the agreement, however, the indigenous communities
          approached the Canadian government declaring that a number of the
          items promised, which would become known as the “Outside Promises”,
          within the treaty had not been handed over to them yet, although
          subjects of the Crown continued to settle the land-based upon the
          agreed-upon Treaty. On April 30, 1875, a council of the federal
          government passed an order stating that it must be ensured that all of
          the Outside Promises were to be fulfilled and considered a part of the
          main agreements within Treaty 1. However, due to the different
          intentions and understandings of the Canadian officials and the
          indigenous communities at the time of its creation, this treaty
          continues to be considered controversial well into the 21st century."
