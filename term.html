          <h2>Terms</h2>
          <p>
            On September 12th, 1871, the <span>treaty</span> was formally
            confirmed by the Governor General in Council. Each band was to
            receive a reserve big enough to give each family of five 160 acres
            (or in like proportion for smaller or larger families). Each man,
            woman, and child was to get a three-dollar gratuity (or one-time
            payment), and each family of five was to receive a yearly annuity of
            $15. The government also committed to forbid the introduction or
            sale of alcohol on reserves and to maintain a school on each
            reserve.
          </p>

          <h2>Terms Signed</h2>
          <p>
            "Treaty 1 was signed by government agents Lieutenant-Governor Adams
            G. Archibald, Commissioner Simpson, Major A.G. Irvine, and eight
            witnesses. The signatories for the Anishinaabe and the Swampy Cree
            were: Red Eagle (Mis-koo-ke-new, or Henry Prince); Bird Forever
            (Ka-ke-ka-penais, or William Pennefather); Flying Down Bird
            (Na-sha-ke-penais); Centre of Bird’s Tail (Na-na-wa-nanan); Flying
            Round (Ke-we-tay-ash); Whip-poor-will (Wa-ko-wush); and Yellow Quill
            (Os-za-we-kwun)."

            unveiled at Lower Fort Garry to honour the creation of Treaty No. 1
            and highlight the connection of the Treaty One Nation to the
            national historic site. This permanent feature includes each First
            Nation’s flag, as well as the Canadian flag and the Union Jack. The
            Legacy Flag Installation is located in an area just outside the
            Fort’s stone walls and is open for free public viewing year-round."
